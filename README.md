  Team Dugong Project Name - Alumni_Donate
  
ABOUT THE PROJECT
    
      This project is basically about creating a platform that allows college organizations to create a simple platform
      for their alumni to give back to the colleges. As a user all you have to do is register on our platform to create
      an account
      for yourself and have a world of endless alumi donation possibilities at your finger tips. Become an authenticated
      user and you have access to click and select an alumni website template that helps you drive your alumni funding
      needs.
      Users of the platform will be divided into two categories with differing access and optimization rights. Namely
      unauthenticated and authenticated users.
    
   
   Unauthenticated Users
    These are users who have not been verifed as a college student.
    
    They can :
    Visit the platform to view basic information about the platform.
    View and interact with the available documentation.
    Register to view more details about the platform.
    Not have access to use until registered.
    

Authenticated Users
      These are users who are registered on the platform and have completed all the
      verification processes.

Authenticated users would:   

      Have full access to the platform.
      Can create a new alumni donation page on their own.
      Must be verified as a college student.
      Be able to generate a shareable link.
      See usage example.
      Can interact with the documentation.
      Can save data and come back to download.
